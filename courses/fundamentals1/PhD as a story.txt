Understanding the vocabulary of the individual cell allows for perturbations

Spatial (re)programming 

Wound healing, organ development

Local rules leads to global emergent phenomena - sometimes changes __ the system unintuitively.

Understanding how different patterning organizes morphogenesis, 

Small off-equilibrium leads to large-scale structure.
We want to harness, or at least start to understand.

Examples: Snowflakes, organoids(?)

Spatiality matters. 

All phenomena can be thought of as list of rules and corresponding boundary conditions:
If we know how gravity pulls on a ball and where it started, we can calculate its trajectory.

Local rules leads to global emergent phenomena - but as we know from chaos theory, sometimes the system reacts unintuitively to changes.

In nature, mind-bogglingly complex, emergent shapes, that seem to stem from relatively simple parts. 
Small-scale symmetry breaks in chemical nonequilibria leads to large-scale structure.

Our hypothesis is, that if we understand the vocabulary of the individual cell (its rules) we can change their by perturbing the initial conditions. 
This is what we call spatial (re)programming.

Right now, a lot of work are put into growing artificial organs as "replacement parts". A reoccurring problem is, that, without us truly understanding why.
