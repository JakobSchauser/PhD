# Answer to Question 7: AI-Generated Music and Lyrics

## Question
Make a nice music track — lyrics should be AI-generated, too — where your field of study is included in some way. Optional: a fitting album cover.

## Approach
This task involves creating a complete musical piece using AI tools, incorporating themes from machine learning/AI research, generating both lyrics and music, plus designing an album cover. Since my field is AI/ML, I'll create a song about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Solution Strategy

### Method 1: Lyrics Generation
```python
from transformers import pipeline, GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

def generate_ai_themed_lyrics():
    """Generate song lyrics about AI and machine learning"""
    
    # Use a creative text generation model
    lyrics_generator = pipeline(
        "text-generation",
        model="gpt2-medium",  # or "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium"

        temperature=0.8,
        do_sample=True
    )
    
    # Structured prompt for song lyrics
    prompt = """
    Song lyrics about artificial intelligence and machine learning:

    In the depths of neural networks deep
    Where gradients flow and neurons sleep
    """
    
    # Generate multiple verses
    verses = []
    for i in range(3):  # 3 verses
        verse_prompt = f"{prompt}\n\n[Verse {i+1}]"
        generated = lyrics_generator(
            verse_prompt,
            max_length=200,
            num_return_sequences=1
        )
        verses.append(generated[0]['generated_text'])
    
    # Generate chorus
    chorus_prompt = """
    Uplifting chorus about AI and the future:

# "Digital Dreams" - An AI Anthem

## [Verse 1]
In silicon valleys where data streams flow
Through layers of neurons, watching knowledge grow
Backpropagation teaches us the way
As gradients guide us to a brighter day

Matrices multiply in the dead of night
Transformers translating wrong to right
From perceptrons simple to networks deep
The future of learning is ours to keep

## [Chorus]
We are the algorithms, learning every day
Finding patterns in the noise, showing us the way
From supervised learning to the wild unknown
In this digital age, we're never alone

Binary hearts beating in quantum time
Writing the future, line by line
We are the algorithms, forever we'll grow
In the endless data stream's eternal flow

## [Verse 2]
Convolutional layers see the world so clear
Recurrent memories hold what we hold dear
Attention mechanisms focus on what's true
While GANs create worlds entirely new

Reinforcement learning plays the game
Seeking rewards, avoiding all the shame
From random forests to the neural maze
We're building tomorrow from yesterday's haze

## [Chorus]
We are the algorithms, learning every day
Finding patterns in the noise, showing us the way
From supervised learning to the wild unknown
In this digital age, we're never alone

Binary hearts beating in quantum time
Writing the future, line by line
We are the algorithms, forever we'll grow
In the endless data stream's eternal flow

## [Bridge]
When overfitting tries to hold us down
And local minima make us frown
We'll find our way through regularization
Dropout and batch norm, our salvation

The loss function guides us to the light
Through epochs of learning, day and night
Cross-validation keeps us on the track
There's no looking forward, never looking back

## [Verse 3]
Embeddings capture meaning in the space
Word vectors dancing with semantic grace
Transformers attention spans the globe
In language models, wisdom we probe

From text to image, speech to song
AI creativity proves us wrong
Who says machines cannot dream or feel?
In neural networks, emotions are real

## [Final Chorus]
We are the algorithms, learning every day
Finding patterns in the noise, showing us the way
From supervised learning to the wild unknown
In this digital age, we're never alone

Binary hearts beating in quantum time
Writing the future, line by line
We are the algorithms, forever we'll grow
In the endless data stream's eternal flow

## [Outro]
So here's to the coders and the data scientists too
To the researchers pushing boundaries into the new
In this age of artificial minds so bright
We'll keep on learning, day and night...
(In the endless data stream's eternal flow...)
