**(Working) Title:**

Investigating Spatial Algorithms for Morphogenetic Patterning in Biological and Artificial Systems

**Short description**

Morphogenetic patterning is a fundamental process underlying the emergent organization of biological tissues and the emergence of complex structures in both natural and synthetic systems. My research will investigate spatial algorithms that govern such patterning, focusing on their applications in both biological and artificial contexts. Using experimental data of early embryonic development, neural cellular automata (NCAs) and theoretical modelling, I will (hopefully) be revealing parallels between artificial and biological patterning mechanisms and self-organizing processes.

**About me**

By unifying the different insights and approaches from biology, physics and computer science, my research aims to bridge the gap between experimentation and modelling, uncovering novel principles with broad applicability.
