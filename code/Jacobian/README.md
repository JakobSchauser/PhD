The pipeline is as follows:

1. Simulate diffusing and otherwise interacting chemicals 
2. Analytically calculate **J**
3. Make spatially and temporally separated "measurements"
4. Estimate **J** from limited information
5. Train a number of NCA's
6. Use these to get alternate **J** estimates
7. Create GRN's from the above 3 **J**'s
8. ...
9. Profit
